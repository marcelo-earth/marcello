Choosing hard things

For me, curiosity doesn’t arise from nothing, because I know people who find pleasure in learning alone. I would love to be more like them. For me, it only emerges from what I’ll do with what I learn. So it’s worth asking: why learn, if it hurts that much?

For a long time, I tried to learn in a way that hurt as little as possible. My goal wasn’t to understand things deeply, but to avoid the discomfort that learning caused me. Even if I ended the day remembering very little, it was enough as long as I could say I had moved something forward. That small sense of progress was what allowed me to keep going.

In relationships, when things are just okay, people often stay together for months or even years. They slowly tolerate discomfort, hoping things will get better, or avoiding the pain of making a decision. But when a relationship becomes truly bad, when the pain is obvious and impossible to ignore, it often ends much faster, in just a few weeks.

This is the Beta-Region Paradox. If you need to go somewhere nearby, you can just walk. But if the place is far, you’ll probably use a bike. Strangely, this means that at a certain point, you arrive faster by choosing the harder option than by choosing the easier one. As if when the destination is farther away, you reach it sooner because you chose difficulty, while when it’s close, you move slower because you chose comfort.

This also helps explain why migration often works so well for the migrant: Starting over from scratch, something deeply human and repeated for hundreds and thousands of years, forces action.

You see it in groups as well: a country in collapse, a persecuted community, a population under attack. When they move, they often rebuild faster in a new place. Not because it’s easier.

Extreme situations don’t give you time to negotiate with yourself. You either move or you break. Moderate discomfort leaves room to delay.

I apply this concept to how I live. I make my life harder on purpose.

When choosing between an easy, familiar path and a challenging, unfamiliar one, I usually choose the challenge. This shows up in two areas of my life.

Buying: Which laptop to choose? Buying a more expensive laptop requires more financial effort, but it gives me greater potential to do great work and deliver better results. I choose the harder option, and I end up with better tools.

Creating: When choosing between staying with a familiar programming language or learning a new one, learning the new one takes more effort but sticking with the familiar means missing out on everything I could achieve, I choose the harder path. I learn something new to build better things.

It’s in the projects I work on, it’s in the things I set out to do. A person can’t choose their luck, but sometimes luck can be hidden behind these small choices.

The immediate result is that my life feels harder than it needs to be. But the difficulty serves a purpose. By choosing intense challenges rather than moderate comfort, I trigger the same psychological mechanisms that the region-beta paradox describes.

Hard challenges force adaptation, while comfort creates the illusion of safety without real progress.

Making my life harder on purpose is something I choose to do. I do it because I’ve learned how people actually adapt to difficulty. The region-beta paradox shows that we’re often wrong about how challenge and recovery work. I thought that avoiding hard situations will make life easier, but it often does the opposite. Now I’d rather face difficult challenges now, build real skills, and actually change, than stay in a constant state of mild discomfort that never really goes away.

Sunset by Richard BladesI’ve been doing this for years, and I think there have been times when I couldn’t hold the difficulty, and choosing hard didn’t get me anything at all.. At least it’s over. Learned something, without wanting to.

Some of the small things I’m grateful for today came after many months of hard work, but they’re mostly side effects. They’re still small, and I’ll probably forget about them in a few months. I don’t think gratitude should depend on results, for a simple reason: no one can control everything. Even wanting to try is already uncommon. That’s why it feels sad when someone wants to act, but can’t, or tries and still fails.

My decision will always be to take on the most challenging path only if it has the potential to be something great, while remaining grateful for what I have. It’s like they say: Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.
