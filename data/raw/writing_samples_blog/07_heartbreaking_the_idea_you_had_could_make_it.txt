Heartbreaking: The idea you had could make it

I see it much more closely than it seems. Less and less, but isn’t it heartbreaking how powerful ideas get lost simply because distribution wasn’t done right?

Yes, it’s true that we’re not overflowing with original ideas. Our conceptions of ideas come from what we’ve seen, from extrapolating concepts. But, well, we all know that ideas don’t matter, only execution. My concern has always been with people who get stuck on execution. As if it were the last thing to do in this world, but it isn’t.

So much potential wasted.

Even a bad idea that gets tested feels better than a brilliant one that never leaves someone’s mind. The truth is, truly good ideas rarely spread just because they are good. Execution matters. Distribution matters.

What scares me most is the thought that people might conclude new ideas aren’t needed. That innovation itself is unnecessary.

I mean, sure, innovation isn’t cheap. It costs time, energy, weekends, doubt. It makes you question whether something doesn’t exist because no one tried hard enough, or because it simply cannot exist. That thought is deceptive. I’ve lost weekends chasing dreams that might never work. Sometimes that chase is necessary. But you can’t live there.

Working in innovation is more an act of love than of money. You feel and know when you’re treading on familiar territory and uncharted territory. Over time, you learn that unexplored paths aren’t gold mines, perhaps being at the frontier of development and research holds a better outcome, a tool that can change everything. But it’s a gamble.

That’s why I try to balance things. Fifty percent safe. Fifty percent experimental. Build something stable while testing the edges. Push forward, but respect that some spaces have already been explored.

Over the last two years, I’ve seen this pattern everywhere: incredible potential locked away. Ideas that could have lived, but never reached the right hands. I keep running against the question, “Why aren’t you doing it?” I try to outrun doubt and intelligence before it catches up.

Most people rarely create new things for the world. And when they do create something, they often fail to distribute it. For those who want to make their work a living thing, that gap is painful. Reaching people is not a natural act, it is not automatic. People don’t evaluate the ideas that come to them, they take what they’re given. And you need to go and give them the ideas in the best way possible, and persistently.

I’ve noticed that there’s a before and after in creative people once they understand distribution. Before, they create in isolation. After, they create with movement.

It’s heartbreaking to see good work go unseen because it never found the right hands. But it’s also hopeful. Because once someone learns how to distribute, their life just changes.

Forever.
