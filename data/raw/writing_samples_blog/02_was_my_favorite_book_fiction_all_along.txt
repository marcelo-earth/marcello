Was my favorite book fiction all along?

Before starting, I read a couple of the pages of this book again. I still love it.

Pacific Coast Highway by Lynn FogelSometimes I notice when art is described as simple or “easy.” But that’s always a matter of perspective. I’ve noticed that when I explore certain collections, many things can feel similar to me, at the same time, if someone looked at my own preferences, they would probably notice the same patterns repeating over and over. This is a human thing and people should enjoy what they like. And maybe that’s why Templado makes so much sense to me. It’s one of those books commonly assigned to teenagers at school, published by Alfaguara, widely read and shared.

It is a story written in the form of a diary. Curiosity gets you to read and wonder “Who wrote this, really? Who wrote it? Did they live near where I live?” Because it mentions places in Lima, a coastal city. I suppose that keeps you hooked for a long story. I also read stories in school that took place in other parts of Latin America, but this isn’t a book that can be exported because of its content.

A diary found by a teacher after his student disappears, later published as a tribute to people who suffer from love. A diary consists of very loose thoughts, scribbles in many parts, and dates that coincide with the calendar. My favorite aspect of realism is the fact that there are blank pages explaining that this is how the diary was, with pages torn out of the notebook and left like that to maintain fidelity to a story written in 2001. Of course, the dates also match up.

One of the most striking aspects is the language. It’s Peruvian Spanish using few swear words from 90s. In some cases, it’s noticeable that a stronger word would fit better there, and I find it funny, but maybe millennials spoke differently. It uses phrases that I’m not sure if they actually existed. Given the effort made to make it seem real, I think they did. 

Diego loves literature, so he writes well. And sometimes he writes badly—but clearly on purpose. The diary format invites you fully into his private world: his confessions, insecurities, and attempts to understand betrayals he’s not ready to process.

The ending is not happy. Not for him, and not really for his family either, even if they don’t seem to fully feel it. The diary continues because writing is a habit he’s committed to. But after the last decisive event in his life, there are no more stories—only thoughts circling around the same pain. No more change, no more movement. Just writing, until the end. The last pages are scattered thoughts, feelings left loose, barely held together.

The dairy makes it clear where everyday happens, and since the author mentions about the new century, I could calculated everything happened in 2001.

There’s barely any mention of politics or economics in the book. Maybe a tiny joke about a government change in “Domingo 6 de mayo,” but nothing more.

At one point, he mentions going down from the Costa Verde on a bicycle, without hands. I always wondered which way. There are only two options: Armendáriz or Balta. There was no bike lane then—there isn’t one even now—so he used the road. I always imagined it was Balta, Armendáriz is just too long, too wide. But then again, he was fourteen, and his brain was only forty percent developed. So maybe it really was Armendáriz.

Maybe that’s why it stayed with me. I never read it as fiction. If I had, it probably wouldn’t be a memorable book. What kept me there was its realism—the feeling that this actually happened to someone.

I’ve been told I give off sci-fi reader vibes, and most of the books I read take place in other cities, other worlds. This one doesn’t. This one happens here.
