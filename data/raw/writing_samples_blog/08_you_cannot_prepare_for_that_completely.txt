You cannot prepare for that completely

There is a very specific kind of doubt that appears right before you create something.

You look at what you built and feel there is about a fifty percent chance it will fail. Not just perform badly. Actually fail.

That number changes how you behave.

When you feel that kind of uncertainty, your first instinct is to add more. More features. More explanations. More polish. You tell yourself that if you are going to spend time and money, you should at least make the attempt “worth it.” If it might fail, then at least let it fail with data. Let it fail with insights. Let it fail with something you can justify.

So you expand it.

What could have been created in a few days now takes weeks. The design becomes cleaner. The backend or database becomes stronger. You keep improving the interface or whatever the surface it is.

But underneath all that work, the probability is still the same. Fifty percent.

Perfection feels responsible. It feels mature. It feels like you are reducing risk. But many times you are not reducing risk. You are delaying contact with reality. You stay in planning mode. You keep adjusting the model in your head instead of letting the world respond.

Reality is simple. It responds with numbers, silence, clicks, or indifference.

You cannot prepare for that completely. You can only face it.

Creating always costs something. It costs time. It costs energy. It costs the chance that you will be publicly wrong. When you feel that the chance of failure is high, you try to protect yourself. You add complexity to feel safer. You make the project bigger so the risk feels justified.

But something I always keep in my heart is that an attempt is always worth it if it teaches you something. A failure is not empty. It has data on it. It shows you where people lose interest. It shows you what they ignore. It shows you which assumption you made that was wrong.

Success can trick you. It can make you believe your model was completely correct, maybe for the wrong reasons. Failure forces you to update your thinking. But not at first, because what if there was some truth in the failure?

What if you missed it?

That’s why my favorite rule is to try something different from two to three times per year. An assumption must be tested to determine whether it is good or bad. If an idea is truly good or bad, it should be either repeatedly successful 😁 or repeatedly a failure 😞.

I like to think this is the rule, because there must be a lot of things out there that are just common sense. But you simply don’t have easy access to them, or know if they exist to begin with. So you do this: You do the hard things, multiple times, and you learn from your mistakes.

At the beginning, success might simply mean that someone notices. Later, it might mean people come back. Or pay. Or tell their friends. What feels like failure today might feel normal next year. The more you create, the more you understand that results are not final judgments, just signals.

Fifty percent certainty feels uncomfortable because you are standing right at the edge. There is enough chance of success to try, and enough doubt to make you hesitate. That tension is not a bad sign. It means you are pushing beyond what is guaranteed. The danger is attachment, so I feel like the best place to be it’s where I shouldn’t be.

When you feel that something has a fifty percent chance of failing, you are at the frontier of learning. It will not feel comfortable. But is where growth happens.
