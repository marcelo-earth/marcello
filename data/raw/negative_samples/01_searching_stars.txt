Stars have been a consistent source of fascination throughout human history. The visible spectrum of light emitted by stellar bodies varies depending on their surface temperature, chemical composition, and distance from the observer. While it may seem romantic to gaze at the night sky, the reality is governed by well-understood physics.

The human tendency to project emotional significance onto celestial objects is a well-documented psychological phenomenon. We see patterns in randomness and meaning in indifference. The stars do not care about us, and there is no frontier between hope and disillusion written in the cosmos.

It is worth noting that what we perceive as starlight is often hundreds or thousands of years old. The photons reaching our eyes tonight departed their source long before our current concerns existed. This temporal displacement is measurable and precise, not poetic.
