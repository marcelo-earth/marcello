Interstellar travel remains largely theoretical given current propulsion technology. The nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, is approximately 4.37 light-years away. At the speed of our fastest spacecraft, reaching it would require tens of thousands of years. Various proposed solutions, including solar sails, nuclear pulse propulsion, and theoretical warp drives, each face significant engineering challenges.

The long-term survival of humanity may indeed require becoming a multi-planetary species. Existential risk researchers have catalogued numerous threats, from asteroid impacts to supervolcanic eruptions, that could render Earth uninhabitable. Establishing self-sustaining colonies on other worlds would serve as a hedge against civilizational extinction.

Current space exploration efforts focus on more achievable near-term objectives: Mars colonization, asteroid mining, and the development of reusable launch vehicles. These incremental advances, while less dramatic than interstellar flight, represent practical steps toward expanding human presence beyond Earth.
