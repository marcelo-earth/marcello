Social software design involves balancing multiple stakeholder interests: users seeking connection, platform operators pursuing growth, and advertisers requiring attention. These interests frequently conflict, creating design tensions that manifest as misaligned incentive structures.

The attention economy framework suggests that platforms compete for a finite pool of user attention. Features designed to maximize engagement metrics often prioritize content that triggers strong emotional responses, which may not align with users' stated preferences or long-term well-being. This misalignment has become a significant topic of public discourse and regulatory attention.

Alternative design approaches have been proposed that prioritize user well-being over engagement metrics. These include time-limiting features, algorithmic transparency, and designs that facilitate meaningful interaction rather than passive consumption. However, the commercial viability of these approaches remains uncertain given current advertising-based revenue models.
