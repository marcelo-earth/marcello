Global crises produce predictable psychological responses across affected populations. Initial shock and denial are followed by periods of anxiety, depression, and ultimately adaptation. These stages, while individually variable, follow broadly consistent patterns that have been documented across diverse types of catastrophic events.

Media consumption during crisis periods amplifies psychological distress through repeated exposure to threatening information. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found that individuals who consumed more than two hours of news coverage daily reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to those who limited their exposure.

Resilience in the face of catastrophe appears to depend on several identifiable factors: social support networks, prior coping experience, access to accurate information, and maintained routine. Communities that preserve social cohesion during crises generally demonstrate faster recovery trajectories than those that experience fragmentation.
